# nextLambdaBoilerplate
A lambda boilerplate with all the new ES7 stuff
## How to use
1) Clone this repo
2) Write your code in `src/` folder
3) `npm run build` will create a bundle with everything and put it in `dist/index.js` 
4) `npm run zip` will create a zip file with the code under the name `toLambda.zip`
5) `npm run upload` will upload the zip in to the lambda function called `test` (**change this to the correct lambda function**)
